# Software Engineering Project Starter Code
The compute engine will convert a positive integer to its English word representation. This includes handling units, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions.

**Input/Output Format:**

   **Input stream:** A sequence of integers, such as 6, 21, 105, 1000000.

  **Delimiters:** The user can specify a pair delimiter such as separating input/result pairs and a key-value delimiter separating an input from its result.

   **Example Output:** With a pair delimiter of ' , ' and a key-value delimiter of ' : ' the output would be:

      6:six,21:twenty one,105:one hundred five,1000000:one million
